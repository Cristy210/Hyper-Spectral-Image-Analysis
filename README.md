<h1> Hyperspectral Image Analysis </h1>
</div>

**Hyperspectral Imaging** is a powerful technique that captures and analyzes a wide spectrum of light across hundreds of narrow bands. This technology allows for detailed material identification, pattern recognition, and classification across diverse fields, including environmental monitoring, medical imaging, agriculture, art conservation, and more.

This repository demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly unsupervised learning techniques, to analyze and interpret hyperspectral datasets. The methods presented provide insights into spectral patterns, material properties, and class segmentation.
